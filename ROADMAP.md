# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally lightweight and non-binding. Priorities may change based on bug reports, security concerns, and community feedback.

If you’d like to propose an item, please open an issue describing the use case.

## Now

- Keep the validators correct, fast, and dependency-free at runtime.
- Maintain compatibility with supported Node.js and TypeScript versions.
- Address bugs and security reports quickly.

## Next

- Improve documentation examples (edge cases, weak vs strict validation).
- Add more test fixtures for real-world inputs and formatting variants.
- Clarify and document versioning/release process.

## Later

- Consider additional utility helpers (only if they keep the API small and stable).
- Evaluate optional ESM support and publishing strategy if demand appears.
